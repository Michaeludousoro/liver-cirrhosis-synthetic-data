Optimise Figures for LaTeX Compilation

Purpose of this module
-----------------------
Matplotlib saves the publication figures at 300 DPI on large canvases, which
produces PNG files of up to several megabytes and tens of megapixels. LaTeX has
to decompress and embed every one of them, and on a metered service such as
Overleaf's free tier the resulting compile can exceed the time limit.

An IEEE single-column figure is about 3.5 inches wide, so even at 600 DPI it
only needs roughly 2100 pixels across. Anything beyond that adds file size and
compile time without adding any detail a reader or printer can resolve.

This script downsamples the numbered paper figures in paper/figures/ so that
neither side exceeds MAX_EDGE pixels, using high-quality Lanczos resampling,
and re-encodes them with maximum PNG compression. Run it after
organise_figures.py:

    python organise_figures.py
    python optimise_figures.py

# Longest edge in pixels. The paper is now set in ACM JDIQ single-column
# manuscript format, where \textwidth is 430.00pt (~5.95 in) rather than the
# ~3.5 in IEEE two-column width this limit was originally calibrated for.
# Figures are placed between 0.58 and 0.98 of that width; 2600 px keeps even
# the widest (0.98\textwidth, ~5.83 in) at roughly 446 DPI in print — still
# comfortably above the 300 DPI publication standard, and consistent with the
# figures already sized for this layout (fig13, fig14, figS15).
