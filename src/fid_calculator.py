Synthetic Data Generation and Predictive Utility Evaluation
for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) — Mayo Clinic Dataset

Purpose of this module
-----------------------
We need a principled way to measure how similar the statistical distribution
of synthetic patient data is to the real patient data. The Fréchet Inception
Distance (FID) is the standard metric for this purpose. Originally developed
for image generation, it has been adapted here for tabular clinical data.

A lower FID score means the synthetic distribution is closer to the real one.
A score of zero would mean the two distributions are identical. In practice
scores well below 1.0 indicate good fidelity for this dataset.

How FID is computed
    FID compares the two distributions by looking at their multivariate
    Gaussian approximations. For each distribution we compute the mean vector
    and the covariance matrix of the feature values. The FID is then:

        FID = squared norm of (mean_real minus mean_synthetic)
            + trace of (covariance_real + covariance_synthetic
                        minus 2 times the square root of the product
                        of the two covariance matrices)

    The second term captures differences in the spread and correlations of
    the features, not just differences in their central tendency.

    We compute FID on the 11 continuous clinical features (bilirubin, albumin,
    etc.) after normalising both datasets with a Min-Max scaler fitted on the
    real data. Normalisation ensures that features measured in very different
    units contribute equally to the distance.

Numerical stability
    The matrix square root of the covariance product is computed using scipy's
    implementation of the Schur decomposition. Small regularisation terms are
    added to the diagonal of each covariance matrix to ensure they are
    positive semi-definite, which is necessary for the matrix square root
    to be well defined.
