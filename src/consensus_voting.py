Consensus Voting
================

Project

Synthetic Data Generation and Predictive Utility Evaluation
for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) — Mayo Clinic Dataset

Purpose of this module
-----------------------
After generating and filtering synthetic data from three different generative
models, we want to identify the subset of synthetic records that multiple
models agree are representative. A record that appears in the realistic region
of GAN output, CTGAN output, and TVAE output simultaneously is more likely to
reflect a genuine pattern in the data than a record that only one model produces.

This is the concept behind consensus voting: we retain only those synthetic
records that are corroborated by at least two of the three generative methods.

How the algorithm works
    We process each method's filtered output in turn, calling it the "candidate
    method" for that round. For each candidate record we measure how close it is
    to the nearest record from each of the other two methods. We work in
    standardised feature space so that differences in measurement scale do not
    give undue weight to features with large numerical values.

    Specifically:
        1. Combine all three filtered datasets and fit a standard scaler on
           the union so every feature has mean zero and unit variance.
        2. For a candidate record from method A, compute the minimum Euclidean
           distance to any record from method B, and separately the minimum
           Euclidean distance to any record from method C.
        3. If the distance to method B is less than the tolerance threshold,
           method B casts a vote for this record. Similarly for method C.
        4. The candidate record is accepted into the consensus set if it
           receives at least min_votes votes (default 2, meaning both B and C
           must endorse it).

    This is repeated for all records from all three methods acting as the
    candidate method in turn, so every filtered synthetic record has the
    opportunity to be included.

    After collecting consensus records, we remove any exact duplicates that
    arose because the same region of feature space was covered by multiple
    methods.

Expected output size
    With properly trained models and the default tolerance of 0.5, we typically
    obtain 50 to 200 consensus records. A very small consensus set suggests the
    models have not converged to the same region of feature space, while a
    very large one (close to the full filtered output) suggests the tolerance
    is too permissive.
