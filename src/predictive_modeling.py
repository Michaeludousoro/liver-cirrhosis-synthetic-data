Predictive Utility Evaluation
==============================

Project
-------
Synthetic Data Generation and Predictive Utility Evaluation
for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) — Mayo Clinic Dataset

Purpose of this module
-----------------------
A synthetic dataset is only truly useful if models trained with it perform
at least as well as models trained on real data alone. Distributional fidelity
metrics like FID tell us whether the synthetic data looks statistically similar
to the real data, but they do not tell us whether the synthetic data is useful
for the task we actually care about, which is predicting patient outcomes.

This module evaluates predictive utility by training classifiers under three
different scenarios and measuring their performance on a held-out real test set.

Training scenarios
    Scenario A: Baseline
        The classifier is trained only on the real training patients.
        This is the reference point against which we compare augmented training.

    Scenario B: Real plus filtered CTGAN
        The real training patients are combined with the IQR-filtered CTGAN
        synthetic records before training. We use CTGAN specifically here
        because it achieved the best FID score among the three individual methods.

    Scenario C: Real plus consensus synthetic
        The real training patients are combined with the consensus synthetic
        records. The consensus set is expected to be the highest quality subset
        because it was endorsed by all three generative models.

Test set rule
    The test set is always and only composed of real patients. It is never
    contaminated with synthetic data. This is essential for a fair comparison:
    we want to know how well the model generalises to real future patients, not
    how well it performs on synthetic ones.

Classifiers evaluated
    Random Forest: an ensemble of decision trees that is robust to feature
    scale and naturally handles mixed feature types.

    Gradient Boosting: a sequential ensemble that often achieves the highest
    accuracy on tabular data by correcting the errors of previous trees.

    Logistic Regression: a linear model that provides an interpretable baseline
    and is useful for assessing whether the prediction problem is linearly
    separable.

Performance metrics
    Accuracy: proportion of test patients correctly classified.
    F1 Score: harmonic mean of precision and recall, weighted by class support.
    Precision: of the patients predicted to have died, how many actually did.
    Recall: of the patients who actually died, how many were correctly predicted.
    AUC: area under the ROC curve, measuring discrimination across all thresholds.
