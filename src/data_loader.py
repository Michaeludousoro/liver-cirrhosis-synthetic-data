Synthetic Data Generation and Predictive Utility Evaluation
for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) — Mayo Clinic Dataset

Purpose of this module
-----------------------
This module is responsible for loading the raw cirrhosis CSV file, removing
every patient record that contains even one missing value (complete-case
analysis), encoding all categorical variables into numbers, and splitting
the data into a training set and a held-out test set.

Why complete-case analysis?
    The original dataset has 418 patients. Rows 313 to 418 belong to an
    observational cohort and are missing most clinical measurements.
    Earlier rows also have scattered missing values in laboratory results.
    Rather than imputing unknown values, we keep only the 276 rows where
    every measurement is present. This avoids any imputation-related bias
    entering our synthetic generation or model evaluation.

Target variable
    Status is encoded as binary: patients who died (D) receive the label 1
    and patients who were censored or received a liver transplant (C or CL)
    receive the label 0.

Author note
    All preprocessing decisions in this module are intentional and match the
    methodology described in the paper. Do not change the encoding maps
    without updating the paper as well.

def load_complete_data(raw_path=RAW_PATH):
    """
    Load the raw CSV, keep only complete rows, and encode all columns.

    This function performs three tasks in sequence.

    First, it reads the raw file and drops the patient ID column because
    an arbitrary identifier carries no clinical meaning and should not
    influence any model.

    Second, it removes every row that has a missing value in any column.
    We treat this as a strict requirement because our generative models
    need to learn from clean, fully observed examples.

    Third, it converts every categorical column to an integer so that
    all downstream code works with purely numeric arrays.

    Convert scaled synthetic samples back into the original measurement units.

    After a generative model produces values in the [0, 1] range, this
    function performs two steps. First it applies the inverse of the Min-Max
    scaler to restore the natural scale of every feature. Second it rounds
    binary and ordinal columns to their valid integer values, because a
    generated value of 0.73 for a binary feature should become 1, and a
    generated value of 3.2 for Stage should become 3.

    Continuous features are clipped at zero because no clinical measurement
    in this dataset can be negative.
