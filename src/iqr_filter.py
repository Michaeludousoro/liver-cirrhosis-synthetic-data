IQR-Based Outlier Filter
========================

Project
-------
Synthetic Data Generation and Predictive Utility Evaluation
for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) — Mayo Clinic Dataset

Purpose of this module
-----------------------
Generative models sometimes produce synthetic patient records whose feature
values fall far outside the range that appears in real clinical data. A
generated bilirubin value of 80 mg/dL, for example, would be physiologically
implausible in this patient population. These extreme outliers can harm
downstream classifiers by pulling decision boundaries away from where real
patients actually cluster.

This module implements an IQR-based filter that removes any synthetic record
containing at least one feature value that would be considered a statistical
outlier relative to the real training data.

How the filter works
    For each continuous feature we compute the first quartile (Q1) and third
    quartile (Q3) from the real training patients. The interquartile range
    (IQR) is Q3 minus Q1. We define the acceptable bounds as:

        lower bound = Q1 minus 1.5 times IQR
        upper bound = Q3 plus 1.5 times IQR

    This is the same rule used in standard box-plot analysis and is well
    established in statistics for identifying outliers. A synthetic record
    is kept only if every one of its continuous feature values falls within
    its respective bounds. A single out-of-range value disqualifies the
    entire record.

Why only continuous features?
    Binary and ordinal features (such as Sex, Ascites, or Stage) have already
    been snapped to their valid integer ranges by the post-processing step
    in data_loader, so there is nothing further to filter there.

Expected retention rates
    For a well-trained generative model we expect to retain roughly 50 to 80
    percent of generated records. Lower retention (such as 20 percent for an
    under-trained GAN) indicates the model has not yet learned the realistic
    range of clinical values and would benefit from more training epochs.

    well each generative model has learned the realistic range of clinical values.
