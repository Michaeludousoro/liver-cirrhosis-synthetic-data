Synthetic Data Generation and Predictive Utility Evaluation
for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) — Mayo Clinic Dataset

Purpose of this module
-----------------------
Reporting FID scores and classification accuracy alone is not enough for
a rigorous scientific paper. We also need to formally test whether the
observed differences between synthetic and real data distributions are
statistically meaningful, and we need to quantify how large those differences
actually are in practice.

This module runs five statistical tests on the real and synthetic feature
distributions. Each test answers a different scientific question about the
quality and fidelity of the generated data.

Tests carried out and what each one tells us
    Shapiro-Wilk normality test
        We test whether each continuous feature in the real training data
        follows a normal distribution. This matters because it determines
        whether we should use parametric or non-parametric comparisons
        elsewhere. A p-value below 0.05 means the feature is not normally
        distributed, and non-parametric tests like KS are therefore more
        appropriate.

    Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test
        For each continuous feature and each synthetic method, we compare
        the full empirical distribution of real values against the synthetic
        values. This test is distribution-free and is sensitive to differences
        anywhere in the distribution, not just in the mean or variance. A
        p-value below 0.05 suggests the synthetic feature distribution differs
        significantly from the real one.

    Jensen-Shannon Divergence
        A symmetric measure of how different two probability distributions are.
        We compute it by discretising each continuous feature into histogram
        bins and comparing the bin proportions. The squared JSD falls between
        zero (identical distributions) and one (completely non-overlapping
        distributions). This gives us a smooth, bounded complement to the KS
        test result.

    Cohen's d effect size
        Measures the standardised mean difference between the real and
        synthetic distributions for each continuous feature. We use this
        because statistical significance alone does not tell us whether a
        difference is practically important. Values near zero indicate
        negligible differences; values above 0.8 indicate large differences
        in the means relative to the spread.

    Chi-square goodness-of-fit test
        For binary and ordinal features (sex, drug assignment, disease stage,
        edema, ascites, hepatomegaly, spiders, and patient status), we check
        whether the proportions in the synthetic data match those in the real
        data. A significant result means the synthetic data assigns different
        frequencies to the categories than the real patient population does.
